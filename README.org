* Qlocktwo word matrix layouter

Say you want to create a [[https://qlocktwo.com/][qlocktwo]] clone. Now you have a set of words
that you need to layout on a (LED) matrix. What is the ideal layout
for your particular set of words? This code will help you find it.

** Usage

Change the words in ~core.clj~ to your language. Choose the size of
your matrix. Then run the code and pick a layout.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ lein run
#+END_EXAMPLE

Be aware that this is a complex problem. Depending on your language
the search space can be in the billions. For the particular dialect of
Swiss German that I'm looking at there are 22992076800 possible
solutions.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
qlocktwo-words.core> (*
			(combo/count-permutations minutes)
			(combo/count-permutations prepositions)
			(combo/count-permutations hours))
22992076800
#+END_SRC

** Examples

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
qlocktwo-words.core> (first (layouts words))
